# Problem Statement 
X Education, an online education company catering to industry professionals, is facing challenges in efficiently converting leads into successful sales. Despite generating a significant number of leads daily, their lead-to-sale conversion rate remains low, at approximately 30%. To enhance the efficiency of their sales process and increase the overall lead conversion rate to around 80%, the company aims to identify and prioritize the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads'.

The objective of this project is to develop a lead scoring model that assigns a lead score to each potential customer based on their characteristics and behavior. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model will analyze various features such as browsing behavior, course interest, form submissions, and past referrals to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a paying customer.

The proposed model will enable X Education to focus its sales efforts more effectively by prioritizing leads with higher conversion probabilities. This approach will optimize resource allocation within the sales team, leading to improved lead nurturing strategies and ultimately higher conversion rates.
